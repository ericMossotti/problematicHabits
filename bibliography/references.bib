	abstract = {Body mass index ({BMI}) is the method of utilizing an adult's height and weight to broadly place them into underweight, normal weight, overweight and obese categories. An individual's {BMI} is important in the determination of potential future health issues and has been widely used as a factor in the determination of various public health policies. {BMI} can be calculated using metric or imperial ({US}) units. Metric units: weight (kilograms) divided by height squared (meters): {BMI} = kg/m2. Imperial ({US}) units: weight (pounds) divided by height squared (inches) multiplied by 703: {BMI} = 703 (lbs/in2). To further discuss {BMI} and the issues, disease states, and clinical significance, it is important to understand the current cut-off points of each category as determined by the World Health Organization ({WHO}) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ({CDC}). World Health Organization:  Severely Underweight: {\textless}16 kg/m2. Underweight: 16.0 to 18.4 kg/m2. Normal weight: 18.5 to 24.9 kg/m2. Overweight: 25.0 to 29.9 kg/m2. Moderately Obese: 30.0 to 34.9 kg/m2. Severely Obese: 35.0 to 39.9 kg/m2. Morbidly Obese: ≥40.0 kg/m2. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention :  Underweight: less than or equal to 18.4 kg/m2. Normal weight: 18.5 to 24.9 kg/m2. Overweight: 25.0 to 39.9 kg/m2. Obese: ≥40.0 kg/m2. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Child and Teen {BMI} (Utilized for those aged 2 to 20): Underweight: below the 5th percentile. Healthy weight: between the 5th and 85th percentile. Overweight: between the 85th and 95th percentile. Obese: greater than or equal to the 95th percentile. World Health Organization Asian-Population Criteria:  Underweight: {\textless}18.5 kg/m2. Normal weight: 18.5 to 23.0 kg/m2. Overweight: 23.0 to 27.5 kg/m2. Obese: ≥27.5 kg/m2 .},
